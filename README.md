### How to Play

The game will start with Socrates on the edge of a petri dish. There will be one bacterial pit and several dirt piles randomly scattered. There will also be pieces of pizza which act as food for the bacteria.

Your goal is to eliminate as many bacteria as you can, within the 3 lives that you have. Bacteria can be attacked using sprays or flamethrower charges.

You have an unlimited quantity of sprays but only 5 flamethrower charges. Sprays travel a longer distance but cause lesser damage and only travel in the direction Socrates is pointing towards. Flamethrower charges cause much more damage and are fired in a circle in all directions, but they travel a much lesser distance than sprays.

There are 3 types of bacteria in this game:

1. Regular Salmonella : Their main goal is to eat food and multiply. Upon eating 3 pieces of food, will split into more. Move randomly in any direction and only cause damage if they're right next to Socrates.
2. Aggressive Salmonella : Same as Regular Salmonella but if they are within a certain radius of Socrates, will try to attack him.
3. Ecoli : Actively try to attack Socrates no matter where they are on the dish. Food is secondary to these lethal bacteria.

There are also "Goodies" in the game which appear randomly, both timing and position wise.

1. Fungus : The only "negative" goodie. Cause damage to Socrates if you make contact with them, then disappear.
2. Health Goodie : Restores Socrates' health to full
3. Flamethrower Goodie : Supplies 5 flamethrower charges
4. Extra life Goodie : Grants an extra life to the player

Eliminating bacteria and/or picking up goodies grant points to the player.   Dieing and/or being hit by the fungus cause a loss in points.

These are the game controls:

`A`     : Move Socrates counterclockwise  
`D`     : Move Socrates clockwise  
`Space` : Fire spray  
`Return`: Fire flamethrower charges  
`Q`     : Quit
